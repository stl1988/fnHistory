# fnHistory
Generates a PDF with many historic Fortnite maps from version 1.6 to the current version. Generation may take a long time and not working 100%.

## Usage
First, open index.html in a plaintext editor of your choice. In order to use this, you have to register an account at fortniteapi.io. After logging in, go to dashboard.fortniteapi.io and copy your API key. Enter it into the index.html source where a comment tells you to put the API key (currently it's line 29).

After that, just open index.html in a web browser and it will generate the PDF for you. Please note this takes a very long time to generate and after generating, it takes a longer time for the download prompt for the PDF. (Maybe I should use smaller map images for any future version of this.)
